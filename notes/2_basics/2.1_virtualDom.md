# Virtual DOM and ReactJS

ReactJS is fast, and a key factor in making it fast is the Virtual DOM.

Say you have components which Render *Navbar, Search Box, Footer*. React creates a Virtual DOM for these components and pushes them to the browser. 

Everytime when you make a change in a component, instead of directly pushing it in the browser and causing a refresh, It'll send that component to the Virtual DOM and it will `render` that component to the browser without toggling a refresh!

### Example

Say you have updated the state of the Search Box due to an Animation, the `searchBox` component will cause the Virtual DOM to create a new Virtual DOM in the background and compare it to the one we created for the initial render.

So the Virtual DOM would just update that part of the search box in our browser instead of the whole page. Saving precious computing power and time.
